# imgcarousel
A generalized image carousel framework

# Introduction
This provides a carousel module for any number of images (4 included in the example).

To run, simply open `public/index.html`

The React code is in `public/js/index.js`, and the CSS code is in `public/css/style.css`

To update the index.js file and see results, simply run the `npm run build` command from the top directory when finished editing. This uses babel and webpack to create the final JS file at `public/dist/bundle.js`.
